Based on the following 5 randomly selected colleges: {', '.join(random_schools)} and after searching on them, 
craft a brief but detailed guide for high school students preparing for the US college search process, 
focusing on the five random colleges.

The guide should include:

1.  **College Search Prep:** Briefly explain how students can best prepare.
2.  **5 Success Tips:** 5 actionable tips for maximizing application success.
3.  **Handling Unexpected Interview Questions:**  Advise on approaching unexpected questions like 
"What is the expanded form of MQTT?" (or similar).  Explain how to respond gracefully even when the answer is unknown, 
avoiding a negative impression.  Include advice on admitting lack of knowledge and pivoting to showcase relevant skills.
